# TextFocusEnhancer

**TextFocusEnhancer** is a JavaScript-based tool designed to improve readability for individuals with reading difficulties or concentration issues. By highlighting the initial letters of words, it helps users focus on the beginning of each word, making text easier to process. This tool is particularly beneficial for people with dyslexia, ADHD, or those who simply need a bit of extra help to stay focused while reading.

## Features

- **Word Highlighting:** Automatically highlights the first letter of words with three or fewer characters and the first two letters of longer words.
- **Exclusion of Certain Elements:** Skips processing text within `<h1>` to `<h6>` and `<b>` or `<strong>` tags to maintain the integrity of headings and already bolded text.
- **Customizable Styling:** Uses a simple CSS class `.my-highlight` to apply bold styling, which can be easily customized.
- **Recursive DOM Traversal:** Efficiently processes text nodes within specified elements using a recursive function, ensuring comprehensive text modification.

## Usage

1. **Include the Code:**
   - Add the provided HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code to your project.

2. **Apply the Class:**
   - Ensure the elements you want to enhance have the class `content`.

3. **Example:**
   ```html
   <div class="content">
       <p>This is a sample text with words of various lengths: a, an, the, example, JavaScript, DOM, HTML, and so on.</p>
       <p><strong>This text is already in bold and should not be processed.</strong></p>
   </div>
   ```

4. **Result:**
   - Words like "a", "an", and "the" will have their first letters bolded.
   - Longer words like "example" and "JavaScript" will have their first two letters bolded.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
